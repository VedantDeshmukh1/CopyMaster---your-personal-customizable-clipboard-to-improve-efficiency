   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CopyMaster

## 📦 Creating an Executable

You can create a standalone executable for easy distribution using cx_Freeze. Here's how:

1. Install cx_Freeze:
   ```
   pip install cx_Freeze
   ```

2. Create a file named `setup.py` in your project directory with the following content:

   ```python
   from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

   setup(
       name="CopyMaster",
       version="2.1",
       description="Helps copy things fast with UI",
       executables=[Executable("clipboard_monitor_v2.py", icon="path/to/your/icon.ico")],
   )
   ```

   Note: Replace `"path/to/your/icon.ico"` with the actual path to your icon file.

3. Run the build process:
   ```
   python setup.py build
   ```

4. Find your executable in the `build` directory.

### Changing the Icon

To change the icon of your executable:

1. Prepare an `.ico` file for your icon. You can convert images to `.ico` format using online tools or image editing software.

2. In the `setup.py` file, specify the path to your `.ico` file in the `Executable` function:

   ```python
   Executable("clipboard_monitor_v2.py", icon="path/to/your/icon.ico")
   ```

3. Run the build process again.

Your executable will now have the custom icon you specified.
